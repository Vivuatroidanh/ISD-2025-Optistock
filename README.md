Inventory Management System - Project source code for ISD 2025


🔍 Project Overview — Warehouse Management System

The system is designed for managing warehouse inventory and production processes related to small-scale components, which are manufactured and packaged in batches.
It aims to optimize workflows including material intake, storage, batch assembly, molding, plating, and final product assembly.

### 💼 Core Features
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 📦 Material Management | Tracks inventory levels, material entries and outputs for each component type |
| 🔗 Production Batch Control | Create, merge, plate, mold, and assemble batches into finished products |
| 🧾 QR Code Tracking | Generate QR codes for each shipment box for instant identification |
| 🔍 External QR Scanner Support | Physical barcode/QR scanners can read directly through the web interface |
| 🕒 Production Timeline History | Logs machine runtime, assembly timestamps, progress, and delivery deadlines |
| 👥 Large User Capacity | Supports 200+ concurrent users |
| 🔐 JWT Security | User authentication and authorization via JSON Web Tokens |
| 🛡 Anti-attack Mechanisms | Prevents SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, brute force attacks, and more |
| 📑 QR Printing for Packaging | Generates printable QR labels for shipment boxes to support rapid tracking |

### 🏗 Tech Stack
| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|
| React.js | Frontend UI/UX + integrated QR scanning |
| Node.js / Express.js | Backend API, authentication logic, middleware handling |
| MySQL | Stores production batches, materials and operational records |
| JWT Authentication | Secure login and role-based access control |
| QR Code Integration | Supports external scanner devices + printable batch QR labels |

### 📤 System Output Expectations
Key outputs generated by the system include:
- Automatic QR code generation for each batch or item container
- Printable QR labels suitable for industrial packaging
- Production timeline reports for each manufacturing stage
- Inventory charts showing daily/monthly in-out-stock metrics
- Full activity logs across the entire user network
- Real-time operational dashboard for monitoring progress

The system is developed with goals of efficiency, accuracy, and fast traceability, optimized for large-scale industrial production environments.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **MySQL** (v5.7 or higher)
- **Git**

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vivuatroidanh/ISD-2025-Opistock.git
cd ISD-2025-Opistock
```

### 2. Backend Setup

Open a **first terminal** for the backend:

```bash
cd backend
```

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm init -y
npm install
```

This will install all required packages including:
- express
- mysql2
- cors
- body-parser
- express-session
- dotenv

#### Configure Database

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```bash
# Server Configuration
PORT=8000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_db_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=inventory_system
DB_PORT=3306
DB_CONNECTION_LIMIT=10

# Session Configuration
SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-key-here-change-in-production
```

**⚠️ Important:** Replace `your_db_username` and `your_db_password` with your actual MySQL credentials.

#### Setup Database

Run the database setup script to create tables and insert sample data:

```bash
node setupdb.js
```

This will:
- Create the `inventory_system` database
- Create all necessary tables
- Insert sample users and data
- Display a summary of created records

#### Start Backend Server

```bash
node server.js
```

The backend API will run on **http://localhost:8000**

You should see:
```
Server running on port 8000
Environment: development
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

Open a **second terminal** for the frontend:

```bash
cd client
```

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### Install Additional Required Packages

```bash
npm install xlsx file-saver
```

These packages are required for:
- `xlsx` - Excel file processing
- `file-saver` - File download functionality

#### Start Frontend Application

```bash
npm start
```

The React application will run on **http://localhost:3000**

Your browser should automatically open to the login page.

## Default Login Credentials

After running `setupdb.js`, you can use these default accounts:

| Username | Password | Role |
|----------|----------|------|
| admin | admin123 | Admin |
| nguyenhieu | password123 | Admin |
| trankhai | password123 | Admin |
| lsd_admin | 123456789 | User |
| user1 | password123 | User |

## Running the Project

### Development Mode

1. **Terminal 1 - Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```
   Backend runs on port **8000**

2. **Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```
   Frontend runs on port **3000**

### Stopping the Servers

- Press `Ctrl + C` in each terminal to stop the servers

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

If you get database connection errors:

1. Verify MySQL is running:
   ```bash
   # On Mac/Linux
   mysql.server status
   
   # On Windows
   net start MySQL
   ```

2. Check your `.env` credentials match your MySQL setup

3. Ensure the database user has proper permissions:
   ```sql
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON inventory_system.* TO 'your_username'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

### Port Already in Use

If port 8000 or 3000 is already in use:

**Backend (port 8000):**
- Change `PORT=8000` in `backend/.env` to another port
- Update API URLs in frontend if needed

**Frontend (port 3000):**
- React will automatically ask to use another port

### Missing node_modules

If you encounter module not found errors:

```bash
# In backend directory
npm install

# In client directory  
npm install
```

### Clean Install

For a fresh installation:

```bash
# Remove existing node_modules and package-lock.json
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Clean install
npm ci
```
