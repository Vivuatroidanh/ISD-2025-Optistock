🔍 Project Overview — Warehouse Management System

The system is designed for managing warehouse inventory and production processes related to small-scale components, which are manufactured and packaged in batches.
It aims to optimize workflows including material intake, storage, batch assembly, molding, plating, and final product assembly.

### 💼 Core Features
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 📦 Material Management | Tracks inventory levels, material entries and outputs for each component type |
| 🔗 Production Batch Control | Create, merge, plate, mold, and assemble batches into finished products |
| 🧾 QR Code Tracking | Generate QR codes for each shipment box for instant identification |
| 🔍 External QR Scanner Support | Physical barcode/QR scanners can read directly through the web interface |
| 🕒 Production Timeline History | Logs machine runtime, assembly timestamps, progress, and delivery deadlines |
| 👥 Large User Capacity | Supports 200+ concurrent users |
| 🔐 JWT Security | User authentication and authorization via JSON Web Tokens |
| 🛡 Anti-attack Mechanisms | Prevents SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, brute force attacks, and more |
| 📑 QR Printing for Packaging | Generates printable QR labels for shipment boxes to support rapid tracking |

### 🏗 Tech Stack
| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|
| React.js | Frontend UI/UX + integrated QR scanning |
| Node.js / Express.js | Backend API, authentication logic, middleware handling |
| MySQL | Stores production batches, materials and operational records |
| JWT Authentication | Secure login and role-based access control |
| QR Code Integration | Supports external scanner devices + printable batch QR labels |

### 📤 System Output Expectations
Key outputs generated by the system include:
- Automatic QR code generation for each batch or item container
- Printable QR labels suitable for industrial packaging
- Production timeline reports for each manufacturing stage
- Inventory charts showing daily/monthly in-out-stock metrics
- Full activity logs across the entire user network
- Real-time operational dashboard for monitoring progress

The system is developed with goals of efficiency, accuracy, and fast traceability, optimized for large-scale industrial production environments.
